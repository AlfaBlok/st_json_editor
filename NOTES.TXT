> When chart type changes, we need to change the config_name to point to a new one api_configuration.
> The previous api_configuration will be deleted.
> We will need to create a new api_configuration with a new config_name.
> This api_configuration will be a deep copy of the default configuration for that chart.
> This api_configuration will be appended to the other api_configurations, in the last place.
> The page_data needs to be updated to point to the new api_configuration


> The api_configuration will be HARDCODED so user can't change it.
